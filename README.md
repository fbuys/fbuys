As a senior software engineer at [OmbuLabs](https://www.ombulabs.com/), I am proud to be making an impact on the tech community. 

I love creating and uplifting those around me. I strive to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.

As a life long learner I constantly look for new challenges.

I am excited about the future and how tech can make a difference in the world.
