👋 Hi, I’m Francois

I’m a dedicated full-stack Ruby engineer who values simplicity, authenticity, and focusing on what truly matters. I love solving complex problems with Ruby, reducing technical debt, and making applications more maintainable and reliable.

Beyond the code, I genuinely enjoy collaboration. I try to bring respect and authenticity to every interaction, and as a husband and father, I care deeply about creating environments where people feel supported, encouraged, and inspired to grow.
